orig sent (0):	i do n't know if we went on an off night \( i have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well \) but , to say i was underwhelmed with bazaar meat is an understatement when we walked in , i was blown away it 's a dark and very chic looking place there is a small casino to your left as you walk in i ca n't believe other restaurants have n't thought of this , it 's such a fantastic idea i 've seen them in clubs , but not restaurants waiting for your table , how about dropping a hundred at roulette \? n nthe hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away we had drink orders taken very quickly so far , so good this place is really an assault on the senses there are smells from the grilling , the music is loud , there are alligator heads on the wall , and employees everywhere the kitchen is very busy , and you can see most of it from the seating area our server started off friendly , and stayed friendly , but he also stayed away from our table this is one of the reasons i am giving 2 stars as the meal wore on , he was nowhere to be seen it took nearly a half hour to get our check also , a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes i know you are crowded , it 's a new hot restaurant on the strip , but these are issues that should n't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge most telling , two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down the glasses remained on the table after they were completed , empty , for the entire 2 5 hour meal this would have been an easy fix , yet there they remained it became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last spoiler alert they were on the table when we left for all i know , they still are n nas other yelpers note , the menu is not your typical steakhouse it was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place i would agree , this is a spot on description we started with the iberico ham , the best ham in the world for 70 you do n't even get 2 ounces \( see my picture \) , but it 's the best ham in the world i never regret buying this stuff , and it was no different at bazaar meat it is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them , sort of a spanish bruschetta the whole thing is fantastic , highly recommended , but it ai n't cheap folks we next went with the chicken croquettes you get 5 6 per order for 12 , and they were fantastic fried perfectly and lots of b u00e9chamel flavor loved these things , i could have easily eaten another order n na couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy i did n't try it , they ate it so quickly i regretted getting one , but we had other things on our mind n nlike the steaks unfortunately , they were out of the lindsay ranch ribeye , which of course i 'd had my eye on since making the reservation as a result , we went with the mishiwa reserve , which is 65 a pound supposedly , our steak weighed 2 5 pounds now , i do n't carry a scale with me to dinner , but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces but , we were hungry , and we ate it rather than complaining we did point it out to our server , but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating he 's absolutely right , but we still were n't happy with the size of this steak i do n't know , maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something also , this is the worst dry aged steak i 've eaten it did n't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging additionally , it was n't adequately seasoned this was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this we ate the steak because we were hungry \( and paid an arm and a leg for it \) , but we were n't happy n nwe also tried the quarter of a suckling pig now we 're talking ! this thing was as advertised juicy , flavorful , with that great crispy skin we got as much meat off of the thing as we could , but all of us could have used more n nfor sides , we went with the delmonico potatoes , asparagus , and carrots all were good , the potatoes were almost too decadent \( if such a state exists \) the asparagus is small , but it was cooked well i could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce the carrots with pepper and greek yogurt was probably the table favorite i 'd absolutely get this dish again n nwe were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal they , like the rest of the meal , were hit and miss n noverall , i 'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in las vegas i do n't know if we went on a bad night \( as noted above , i 've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did , november 15 , 2014 , that complained about the service \) i also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues but , for what we paid , a lot of the things are close to inexcusable i 'd return , but not for a long time , and i will definitely bring a scale
